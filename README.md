### How to

> War is a two player card game where the player with the highest card wins each round! For ex. if player 1 has a king of hearts and player two has a 10 of diamonds player 1 wins that prespective round! 
> 
> When both players get a tie they go into WAR!

> War means that both players have to leave their cards down that are tied and pull 3 cards from their pile, keep them faced down and the 4th card is faced up, and whos ever is the highest wins that war!
