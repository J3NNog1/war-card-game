### How to

> War is a two-player card game where the player with the highest card wins each round! For example, if player 1 has a king of hearts and player two has a 10 of diamonds player 1 wins that perspective round!
> 
> When both players get a tie, they go into WAR!
> 
> War means that both players have to leave their cards down that are tied and pull 3 cards from their pile, keep them faced down and the 4th card is faced up, and whos ever is the highest wins that war!
> 
> Sometimes you can get a single war, double war, and in rare cases triple war!
